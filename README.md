# TOMATO-LEAF-DISEASE
This project aims to develop a robust and accurate CNN-based model to classify tomato plant leaf diseases from digital images. By leveraging the power of deep learning, the model will be trained to identify various disease types, including early blight, late blight, leaf mold, septoria leaf spot, spider mites, and healthy leaves.

Key Components:

Dataset:

Utilize a publicly available dataset of labeled tomato leaf images, such as PlantVillage 
(https://public.roboflow.com/).
If necessary, consider collecting and annotating your own images to capture regional variations or specific diseases not present in public datasets.
Data Preprocessing:

Resize and normalize images for consistency.
Apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., random cropping, flipping, color jittering) to increase training data diversity and prevent overfitting.
CNN Model Architecture:

Start with a well-established CNN architecture like VGG16, ResNet50, or InceptionV3 as a base model. These models have been pre-trained on large image datasets and can extract valuable features.
Fine-tune the base model by replacing the final classification layers with your own set of neurons, one for each disease class and a healthy class.
Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of filters, learning rate, optimizer) to optimize performance.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Use the training set to train the model, the validation set to monitor for overfitting and adjust hyperparameters as needed, and the testing set to evaluate the final model's performance.
Evaluation:

Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying different diseaseÂ classes.
